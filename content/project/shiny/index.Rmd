Shiny is an open-sourced R library for creating interactive applications for data visualization, exploration, and analysis. I have utilized shiny to create web-ready applications for several public sector agencies, which allow users to explore and manipulate data with great flexibility and ease. These applications often include both spatial and tabular data that are combined through a seemless data pipeline that is fully transparent and reproducible. Code for all the apps below can be found on [github](https://github.com/rhaefer/shiny).

Shiny Examples:

- [Interactive Geospatial Zoning Tool](https://trpa-shiny-apps.shinyapps.io/use_dashboard)
- [Using Big Data For Transportation Planning](https://trpa-shiny-apps.shinyapps.io/volumes_dashboard)
