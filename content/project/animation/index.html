<p>Animations are a useful for displaying dynamic changes in data over time and space. We utilize quick and cost-effective animation libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate">gganimate</a> to create data visualizations for mapping and other purposes. The example below displays vehicle crashes in the Lake Tahoe rgion over time.</p>
