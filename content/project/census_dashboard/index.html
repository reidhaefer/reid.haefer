<p>Aquiring accurate and reliable data is a crucial element of an analytical project. Increasingly, data is stored and made available through online databases, including APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). We develop automated processes that quickly and efficient collect and organize data into clean formats that are ready for analysis. For example, the U.S. Census is a primary source of the socioeconomic data used for urban planning and demographic anlaysis but the data is often difficult to acquire, manage, and interpret. We developed a tool that collects socioeconomic data through the Census API and presents the resulting database in an interactive, web-based format.</p>
