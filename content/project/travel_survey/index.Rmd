Reports are increasingly accessed via web and mobile technologies that enable the user quick and interactive access to report content. Web-based reports have several advantages over traditional static documents including interactive webmaps and charts, dynamic table of contents, and downloadable content.

This report summarizes the methodology and results of the 2018 TRPA Summer Travel using [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). All development [code can be found on gituhub here](https://github.com/trpa-reid/travel_survey/blob/master/travel_survey_report.Rmd)
