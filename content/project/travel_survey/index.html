<p>Travel Surveys are an important input of travel models and help researchers understand regional travel behavior. I managed the 2018 TRPA Summer Travel Survey, which consisted of a field-based intercept travel survey. This report summarizes the survey methodology and results in an interactive web-based format. The report was created entirely in R using Rmarkdown. All development <a href="https://github.com/trpa-reid/travel_survey/blob/master/travel_survey_report.Rmd">code can be found here.</a></p>
