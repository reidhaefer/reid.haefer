<p>Activity-based travel models (ABMs) are useful tools for estimating and forecasting transportation conditions by microsimulating the behavior of all parties and individuals that travel within a region. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency was one of the original adopters of the CT-RAMP framework for ABMs and maintains the model in order to understand both resident and visitor travel in the Tahoe region of California and Nevada. As part of my role as managing the Tahoe model, I created an R-Shiny based tool for daylighting this useful but complex tool.</p>
