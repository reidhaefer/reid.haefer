<p>Using the <a href="https://ebird.org/home">eBird app</a>, I record observations of the birds I identify while traveling and around my home. I created a workflow for obtaining and wrangling my eBird database with ‘google sheets’ and ‘dplyr’, as well as a visualization of my bird observations using ‘Rmarkdown’ with additional usage of ‘leaflet’ and ‘datatable’. The result is a quick and easy way to track and understand the various birds that I have observed over time.</p>
