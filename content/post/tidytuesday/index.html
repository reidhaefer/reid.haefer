<p>As part of the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">R For Data Science TidyTuesday series</a>, I analyzed data from the first annual <a href="https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/">Central Park Squirrel Census</a>. The 2018 <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/06/squirrel-census-results-population-central-park-nyc/592162/">survey</a> identified over 2,000 individual squirrels in New York Cityâ€™s Central Park and documented detailed individual characteristics such as location, age, color &amp; behavior.</p>
