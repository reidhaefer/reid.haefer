<p>During the end of 2019, wildfires proliferated across Australia. As part of the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">R For Data Science TidyTuesday series</a>, I analyzed Australian temperature and rainfall data to attempt to discern potential contributers to the historic and devastating fires. The visualizations below were created using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>. All code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/reidhaefer/reid.haefer/blob/master/content/post/aussie_fires/index.Rmd">github here</a>.</p>
