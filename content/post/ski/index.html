<p>Information about snowpack and weather conditions is important for safe and enjoyable experiences skiing in the backcountry. I track my ski tours using <a href="https://www.gaiagps.com/">GAIA GPS</a> and record information on each tour, such as elevation gain, weather, and other observations. This <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">rmarkdown</a> webapp displays some of the backcountry ski tours Iâ€™ve taken over the last few years, including a custom basemap I created using <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>.</p>
