Information about snowpack and weather conditions is important for safe and enjoyable experiences skiing in the backcountry. I track my ski tours using [GAIA GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/) and record information on each tour, such as elevation gain, weather, and other observations. This [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) webapp displays some of the backcountry ski tours I've taken over the last few years, including a custom basemap I created using [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
