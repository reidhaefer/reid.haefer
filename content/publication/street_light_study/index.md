abstract: There is limited understanding of aggregate quantities and characteristics of public street and area lighting installations across the United States, despite the fact that associated expenditures on electricity can be a significant component of municipal energy budgets, frequently accounting for up to or even exceeding half (e.g., see Figure 1.) Nevertheless, a growing number of municipalities and other government agencies are recognizing high performance street and outdoor lighting as a means to save energy and money, and reduce associated carbon emissions.
