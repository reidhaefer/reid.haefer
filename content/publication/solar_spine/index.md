abstract: The Solar Spine strives to make Chandigarh a national leader in sustainable development by addressing challenges of urban sanitation, energy demand, resource scarcity, and gender equality. India, just like the rest of the world, is challenged by a future promising extensive population growth, which requires we live in a more sustainable manner. Currently, energy supply in India frequently does not meet its demand. Thus it is imperative that India invests in alternative energy to reduce an increasingly burdened energy supply system. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) designated Chandigarh as one of sixty Solar Cities across India to be a model city for renewable energy in planning and development. We propose a revitalized corridor along the northern edge of Chandigarh’s Capitol complex that will stand as a center for women’s empowerment, sustainable infrastructure, and renewable energy. Restoration will address sanitation, waste management, and stormwater drainage concerns that plague this corridor. The Center, named Surya Deviya, will be women run and include a restaurant that is entirely powered by renewable energies. A biogas facility will convert human excrement into cooking fuel on site. Stormwater infrastructure in the trench will improve overall sanitation and provide water for the biogas facility. The slurry (waste) from the biogas facility will be used as organic manure for green agriculture in the surrounding area. Solar panels will provide shade and electricity to the restaurant and the accompanying classroom. This classroom will be used for technical and occupational training in renewable energies, as well as for youth education. The Surya Deviya Center is just one part of the greater whole – the entire solar-spine revitalizes the corridor into a backbone for future prosperity by linking the existing land uses with sustainable infrastructure. With the present demands on energy supply and resource availability, the Solar Spine and Surya Deviya Center position Chandigarh as a model city and offer hope for national and global action towards a sustainable future.
